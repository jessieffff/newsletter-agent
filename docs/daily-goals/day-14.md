# Day 14 — Polish + launch checklist

## Goal
A demo-ready MVP you can ship and iterate on.

## Deliverables
- Onboarding flow
- Launch checklist + demo script

## TODO
- [ ] Improve settings UX (chips/cards/preview)
- [ ] Onboarding wizard (topic → frequency → sources → test)
- [ ] Cost guardrails (max items/tool calls/tokens)
- [ ] Smoke tests + demo script

## Acceptance checks
- New user: zero → first email in < 3 minutes
- Demo works end-to-end without manual fixes
