# Day 12 — Observability + evaluation harness

## Goal
Debug and improve quality quickly.

## Deliverables
- Tracing/logging per run
- Small eval dataset + script

## TODO
- [ ] Add trace/run IDs
- [ ] Build eval dataset (10 subs × 2 runs)
- [ ] Add checks: duplicates, missing URLs, too-long summaries
- [ ] Track quality metrics

## Acceptance checks
- You can explain why an item appeared using logs/traces
- Eval script outputs a simple report
