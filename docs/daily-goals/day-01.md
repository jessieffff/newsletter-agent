# Day 01 — Product definition + repo alignment

## Goal
Lock the MVP scope and the exact user workflow so implementation stays focused.

## Deliverables
- PRD (1 page) in `docs/prd.md`
- Data model doc in `docs/data-model.md`
- Launch definition in `docs/launch-checklist.md`

## TODO
- [x] Write the MVP user story end-to-end (configure → generate → email → history)
- [x] Define Subscription + NewsletterRun schemas
- [x] Decide v1 sources (RSS mandatory; others optional)
- [x] List explicit non-goals for v1

## Acceptance checks
- One-page PRD exists and is unambiguous
- One canonical schema exists for Subscription + Run
